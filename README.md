## Technology choices
The following technologies were used in the development of this project:
- React v18.2.0
- React DOM v18.2.0
- React Router v6.8.0
- React Router DOM v6.8.0
- React Google Maps v9.4.5
- Axios v1.2.6
- Daisy UI v2.49.0
- React Icons v4.7.1
- Jest DOM v5.16.5
- React Testing Library v13.4.0
- User Event v13.5.0

These technologies were selected for their reliability and ease of use. React and React DOM provide a robust framework for building dynamic user interfaces, while React Router and React Router DOM make it easy to manage and navigate between different pages of the app. React Google Maps integrates the Google Maps API with React, and Axios is used for making API requests. Daisy UI and React Icons are used for styling and providing icons for the app. Jest DOM and React Testing Library are used for testing the app, although the tests have not been run at this time.
